# The startup of you

The Business Insider published a [presentation](http://www.businessinsider.com/career-advice-from-linkedins-founder-2013-3?op=1) from LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.

It is an executive summary of his 2012 book titled [The start-up of you](http://www.amazon.com/The-Start-up-You-Transform-ebook/dp/B0050DIWHU) which was resonating my recent thoughts so I thought I would publish a summary of that summary here.

Hope it's enough to take the key points across. In case it isn't the notes are only useful to me but have a look at the [original presentation](http://www.businessinsider.com/career-advice-from-linkedins-founder-2013-3?op=1) or maybe even grab the [book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Start-up-You-Transform-ebook/dp/B0050DIWHU).

## All human beings are entrepreneurs

* everyone was self employed in caves but civilization supresses it
* today's challenging professional life requires us to rediscover **entrepreneurial intincts**
* you have at least one startup venture: **your career**
* old career ladder approach and old work assumptions doesn't work anymore
* **permanent beta - &infin; &beta;**
   * think of yourself as a work-in-progress
   * invest in yourself every-day
* entrepreneurial adaptive **skill set**

## Develop a competitive advantage

* differentiate or die
* chart a career path that sets you apart
* you only need to be better than your local, professional niche
* **assets**: soft (knowledge, skills, connections) and hard (cash)
* **aspirations and values**: where you might like to go in the futute
* **market realities**: what people are willing to pay for
* **none of them works without the others**
* skills no-one is paying for :(
* aspirations without the skills :(
* being a slave to the market regardless of aspirations :(
* **upgrade skills** or **change the environment** (market)

## Plan to adapt

* popular advice
    * where do you want be in x years?, then plan
    * find your passion then pursue it
* strengths but HUGE drawback: they presume a static world
* everything changes
* **accurate self-knowledge** is attainable only **via experimentation** (and not introspection)
* **flexibly persistent**
    * always ready to adapt
    * but also persistent in driving towards goals
* **make assumptions a hypotheses explicit** (about yourself/industry)
* prioritize learning over profitabilty (soft over hard assets)
* learn by doing: actions not plans
* maximize follow-on opportunities
* **ABZ planning**:
    * experimental plan A
    * alternative plan B
    * unchanging, certain plan Z (a lifeboat)

## It takes a network

* **every job boils down to interacting with people**
* people control resources, opportunities, information
* people you spend time with shape your personality
* **I^we**: individuals power raised exponentially with a team (network)
* professional relationships
* **allies**
    * advice, proactive collaboration
    * shared interests, promote, defend
* **weaker ties**
    * introduce diversity
    * opportunities and intelligence outside inner circle
* your network is bigger then you think: use introductions to leverage
* **strenghten relationships** otherwise they get weaker

## Pursue breakout opportunities

* trajectory of remarkable careers tipically has breakouts
* breakout opportunity: career experiences that led to unusually rapid gains
* habits of behavior to increase the likelihood of this
    * be in motion and court selective randomness
    * tap the networks and associations
    * opportunities are attached to people
    * sometimes have to hustle
    * constrains can encourage resourcefulness

## Take intelligent risks

* risk: isn't an enemy - **permanent part of life**
* being proactively intelligent about risks is a prerequisite for breakouts
* every possible career move has risks
* **no risks? it's not a breakout**
* risk: personal and situational
* most people **over-estimate**
* can **tolerate the worst-case outcome?** then be open to it.
* **don't conflate with uncertainity**
* buildup **resilience to an unimaganable blowup**
* stability by introducing low levels of volatility
    * by introducing **small risks on a regular basis**
    * ideally your day job has volatility built in

## Who you know is what you know
* how you gather, manage and use **information** will determine if you loose or win
* stockpiling facts doesn't get you anywhere because **everything is changing**
* **intelligence by talking to people**
    * to understand assets, aspirations, market realities
    * help to track risks attached to an opportunity
* network intelligence: map your network, get useful answers

##  &infin; &beta; - never stop starting
